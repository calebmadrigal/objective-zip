This is a copy of [objective-zip library](http://code.google.com/p/objective-zip/) developed by [Flying Dolphin Studio](http://www.flyingdolphinstudio.com). 

I just changed it over to use ARC.

To add to your XCode project, do the following:

* Add the MiniZip and Objective-Zip folders to the project.
* Under Build Phases -> Link Binary With Libraries, add a link to libz (the version I used was libz.1.1.3.dylib).
